### NJ Trails Inventory
The New Jersey Trails Inventory was created in order to capture all off-road, recreational trail facilities in DVRPC's New Jersey Counties, including those outside The Circuit. The inventory is intended for planning purposes and was compiled using several sources including County planners, open data portals, PDF park and trail maps available online, Google Maps' trails layer, and Strava's Global Heatmap. Trails were manually verified and corrected using leaf-off aerial imagery and other sources of reasonable reliability.
